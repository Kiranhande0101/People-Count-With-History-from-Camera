# People Count with History from Camera

This project implements real-time people counting with historical data tracking from video feeds using a webcam or IP camera. The system leverages object detection techniques to detect and count people, and it tracks and stores data about detected individuals, including their last visit time.

## Features

- **Real-Time People Counting:** Utilizes Python with libraries like OpenCV and YOLO for detecting and counting people in video feeds.
- **Data Tracking and Storage:** Maintains a history of detected individuals and stores their last visit time in a database or file for future reference.
- **Integration with Camera Sources:** Supports integration with various camera sources, including webcams and IP cameras.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection
- Database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL) or file storage for tracking data
- Additional Python libraries: numpy, scipy, etc.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/people-count-with-history.git
   cd people-count-with-history
   ```

2. **Install the Required Libraries:**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up the YOLO Model:**

   Download the pre-trained YOLO weights and configuration files from the official [YOLO website](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/).

4. **Configure the Database:**

   Ensure you have a database set up to store historical data. Update the `config.json` file with your database credentials and configuration details.

## Usage

1. **Run the People Counter:**

   ```sh
   python people_counter.py
   ```

2. **Configuration:**

   Edit the `config.json` file to match your camera source and database configuration.

## Directory Structure

- `people_counter.py`: Main script for running the people counting system.
- `utils/`: Contains utility scripts, including the mailer and configuration handler.
- `tracker/`: Includes the centroid tracker for tracking detected individuals.
- `config.json`: Configuration file for database and camera settings.

## Deliverables

- **Source Code:** Complete source code for object counting and analysis.
- **Camera Integration:** Code for integrating with various camera sources.
- **Historical Data Tracking:** Functionality to keep and store a history of detected individuals and their last visit time.
